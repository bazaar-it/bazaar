# Main TODO List

## Sprint 115 — Community (Docs & Planning)
- Seeded sprint docs: data model, auth, UX, metrics, migration plan
- Next: align with Sprint 93 admin templates for code reuse
- Plan additive migrations for `community_*` tables (dev only first)

1. test and poropely integrate the promo code functilaity. migrations are not pushed, neither to prod and dev db. 

2. make the brain being able to do multo context tool decision. lets say a user have genered 4 scenes. and they say, 'mke them all a bit more faster paced', or i like scene 3 the best, make the other scenes hve more the neergy of scene 3', it will edit all the scenes to be faster paced, or change scene 1, 2, and 4 to look more like scen 3 . in one iteration, aka just form that one user prompt. now it will just do 1 iterations at the time, but we want it to be able to to several things in 1 prompt. so one things is allowing the backend brain to choose severla tools, another thing is the UI. we would like some sort of UI for it, now we have the generating... pulsating, on every reposinse, but for a multi, we would might want somehting in the sense of a little bulletpoint thing. where its a dynamic bulle tpoint list. and when its wokring on bullet point1, its generting, whiile the pthers are waiting. and it says what its actually doing, so the UI for this would be dynamic reletive to the decions of the brin. so if a user has 4 scenes, and pormpt, make them all more fast paced, it would quickly, the brain would quite quickly make the deciions, esit scene1 to be more fast paced, edit scene 2 to be more fast pace, etc etc, and it ould start by editing scene 1, user would see the 4 bulle tpoints, and that point 1 is generting, and that 2-4 is waiting, and when scene 1 is ready, the actual scene, the video in the preview panel would be updated, and so user can see that scene 1 is indeed more fast paced, and the ui in the chat would saybullet point 1 is finsihed, and that it is now orking on bullet point 2. kinda like in claude code. and same prisniplce if a user is saying, i want a full 20 seconds video, apple style, with the newest trends, about my new produt et etc . brain miught decide to start with a context search, so we would need a new tool, a contextgatherer, that has web access and can search the net for . apple style, new est strends, etc etc, and it gathers all the conetxt insomehwere that the other tools and agents has access to, so bullet point one, gather context, and when its done with context gatherings, it start of by scene 1, scne 2 and scen 3, which all uti;izes the context builder, and build on eachother. and the user might at any times stop the agent, and change some of the text, might click into bulle tpoint 3 and change the text or whatever. 
so i know there is a lot of information here, but lets start doing some reasearch on what swould need to be true in order for this to work. wewould need some different system for conetxt management. this is very inmportant, we want a good system here, because contextengineering is the newest best and most important thing. more o than pormpt engineering. also, we would need an agent that has web capabilities. and we would ened some new ui. and we would need to make sure the brain knows that it ha new capabiilties in terms of choosing multi tools deciions. 

lets also make ome new agents here in claude code. one uI agent, that analysis the styling of the components, are they consistent, so the have correct state update, are they optimal, etc etc. 

a agent that is reposinble for taking an idea of a conecpt ofr a feature, and doind a lot of research on what ohter ilfes or system are affected, implictions agent, that it job is to take a conect and 'oh u wanan build that? well, in theoiry that might sound easy, but rememebr that u have X, Y, and Z, and these things also need to be adopted, because yu might think you system work like this but in theoiry its actually dont this other way' so it saves us from generting techical depth and over compelx systems. 

help me generate system pormpts for these agents. 

another agent also that is reposinble for searching the web and analysing what other new trends that we might use inetad. for exmpale, in the beginning of mcp area, it mighjt check myu proopsoed suggestion on how to implement somehting and it would stop me and sya, hey, thats not a bad idea, but uy might wanna consider doing it this way inetad, because all of new the startsups and forwardlooking companies are building on this mcp framwrosk, so it might not be a bad idea for u to do it this way intead. 



---
also, lets make the admin interface a buit better. being able to find projects, just by filtering on project id. that would be beneficial. so being able to search for projectsin the main admin page. also, how difficutk would it be to being able to search for something, and then having a AI, like u now ihave in claude code , who can take that english text, and generete sql quires and runquieries on the databse, and then providing that infromaiton? so a intelligence layer within the admin interface? so for exmaple a user could search for asomehting like  'how many project has been created last week, by users who signed up earlier than a week a go ? --- also we would need some good trkcing for these promo codes. iof generitn promo cidesand provindg free credits, we would need to be able to track the usage of the promo code etc. in a good wat. 
================================================================================================================================================

--------
delete   1. componentErrors - Only defined in schema, no active usage
  2. sceneSpecs - MCP architecture remnant, not implemented
  3. componentTestCases - Evaluation system uses hardcoded tests instead
  4. componentEvaluationMetrics - Not used by evaluation framework
  5. agentMessages - A2A protocol feature never implemented 
  from the database
-----

================================================================================================================================================

⏺ Summary:

  2. Brain Types Consolidation (Do Later)

  - BrainDecision is used by 3 generation routers
  - Can be migrated to use ToolSelectionResult from brain.types.ts
  - Would improve type safety with enums instead of string literals
  - Requires updating the generation routers to map the orchestrator output properly

  3. Database Types Migration (Do Later)

  - The manual Project type in /src/lib/types/database/ is barely used (only 1 import)
  - But there's a local Project type defined in MyProjectsPanelG.tsx
  - The generated entities already have ProjectEntity that could replace both
  - Migration would ensure types stay in sync with database schema

  Both of these are good improvements to make later for better type safety and
  consistency. The manual types can get out of sync with the database, and the string
  literals in BrainDecision are less type-safe than the enums in brain.types.ts.

================================================================================================================================================



Critical 1:
Alright, so there's a small problem with the duration of the scenes. So, every scene that our system is making is default 6 seconds. So, you can see that now, and the code that was just generated, very good code, very nice. The problem, however, is that the scene code is 3 seconds. You can see that clearly in the code. It's 3 seconds long. But the scene itself in the motion player is 6 seconds. Because for some reason, it's like a default 6 seconds. We need a way to actually change the duration of the scene. Not within the code, but in the video state of the duration of that scene, such that it matches what the code says. Because now I even asked for 3 seconds long animation. And yeah, so like the code itself was like an animation for 3 seconds. But the scene was, the duration of the scene is still 6 seconds. Can you please help me find out why we always, for some reason, have that default of 6 seconds instead of actually adjusting correctly of the actual duration in the scene? Thank you.

✅ **Critical 4: CASCADE FAILURE & AUTOFIX FIXED** (Completed - January 24, 2025)
**Issue 1 - Cascade Failure**: When Scene 2 has compilation errors, it makes Scene 1 (perfectly valid) also fail and crash
**Issue 2 - Missing AutoFix**: AutoFix button doesn't appear when scene compilation fails
**Root Cause**: Multi-scene composition fails entirely when any scene has errors; autofix event system not properly connected
**Technical Fix**: 
- Enhanced scene isolation in PreviewPanelG - broken scenes get safe fallbacks, working scenes continue
- Fixed autofix event flow with better debugging and direct triggers from error boundaries
- Added beautiful error UI with Reid Hoffman quote and autofix buttons
**Result**: ✅ One broken scene never affects other working scenes; AutoFix button appears immediately and works perfectly





✅ **Critical 2: TRANSCRIPTION FIXED** (Completed - January 24, 2025)
**Issue**: `File` constructor error causing transcription to fail completely
**Root Cause**: Code was trying to use `new File()` constructor which doesn't exist in Node.js server environment
**Technical Fix**: Removed unnecessary File conversion and pass original formData file directly to OpenAI
**Result**: ✅ Voice transcription now works perfectly - users can record audio and get transcripts immediately

~~Error: Failed to transcribe audio. Please try again.
So for some reason transcription doesn't work. That is critical. It just says idle. So like now we have like a user just talks in for like two minutes and then the audio is lost. That is unsustainable. That is super critical. That needs to be fixed. A user clicks on the transcribe in the chat panel. Chat panel G, they click transcribe and then when they click finished, not stop, but finished, now it just got lost. So they just lose it. That needs to be fixed. That is high priority.Error: Failed to transcribe audio. Please try again.

Critical 3: 
So it was actually quite an easy fix. It was just like the fact that our code generator, for some reason, I had added an x to the code in the beginning. But I went into the code panel, I tried to just like the first, for some reason, the first line was like an x. But then, when I deleted the x and I clicked save, the save button in the code panel did not automatically trigger a refresh. So it's important that in the code panel, the save button automatically triggers an update to the video state. Because what happens was that I clicked save, and then boom, it wasn't idle, and it reverted back to the scene, the old scene that had the x in it. So, you know, when you update the code and you click save, even though it said save in the chat panel, in the chat panel it said, oh yeah, you updated scene two, you updated scene two. So the chat panel knew that it was updated, but it seems like the video state or maybe some cache or local storage did not become overwritten. So it still tried to show that video with the code that was idle in it.


✅ **Critical 4: IMAGE PERSISTENCE FIX - RESOLVED** (February 3, 2025) 
**Issue**: Images disappeared from chat messages after page refresh
**Root Cause**: Missing `imageUrls` field in `DbMessage` TypeScript interface  
**Impact**: Users lost image context after browser refresh, breaking conversation continuity
**Fix Applied**: Updated ChatPanelG.tsx `DbMessage` interface to include `imageUrls: string[] | null`
**Status**: 🟢 **FIXED** - Images now persist across page refreshes

~~Crirital 4: When you upload an image, that whole thing works perfectly fine, but when you then refresh the page and you look at that message that included an image, the image is gone from the message. So it looks like the image is only put into the video state or like some local storage and not the database. Or maybe it is inserted into the database, but it seems like the chat panel, after you do like a manual refresh, the image disappears, like the preview of the image disappears. So ideally, we will just always show that preview of the image from a message. That would be the best, but like a backup solution could be just like if the message included an image, it should say like image included in the message somewhere. But yeah, ideally, we just like if a message included an image, we should just always have that image included in that message in the chat panel.~~


✅ **Critical 5: CLAUDE TOKEN LIMIT FIX - RESOLVED** (February 3, 2025)
**Issue**: EditScene operations failing on ALL Claude models with "max_tokens: 16000 > 8192" error
**Root Cause**: Model configuration set 16k tokens for all providers, but Claude only supports 8k
**Impact**: Complete editScene failure for Mixed Pack, Claude Pack, Haiku Pack (60% of configurations)
**Fix Applied**: Updated `src/config/models.config.ts` - Claude models: 16k → 8k tokens
**Status**: 🟢 **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER RESOLVED** - All model packs now functional

## ✅ **CRITICAL CHATPANELG BUGS FIXED** (Completed - January 17, 2025)

- [x] **🖼️ Image Upload Backend Failure**: ✅ **FIXED**
  - **Issue**: ChatPanelG tries to POST to `/api/upload` which doesn't exist
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend uses wrong endpoint - should use `/api/r2-presign` for presigned URL flow
  - **Impact**: Users can upload images via UI but backend never receives them
  - **Fix**: ✅ Created `/api/upload/route.ts` with direct R2 upload functionality matching ChatPanelG's FormData interface

- [x] **🔄 Progress Messages Destroying Real Flow**: ✅ **FIXED**
  - **Issue**: 50 hardcoded progress messages cycle every 2 seconds and override real AI responses  
  - **Root Cause**: Progress interval continues after generation completes, overwriting actual responses
  - **Impact**: Users never see real AI responses, only random progress messages
  - **Fix**: ✅ Completely removed the problematic progress message system - now real AI responses show through without interference

## ✅ **STATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 100% UNIFIED** (February 2, 2025) ⭐ **COMPLETE SUCCESS**

### **🎯 Problem Solved**: Every User Operation Now Uses Unified State Management
**Final Fix**: Template panel and all scene generation now use `updateAndRefresh()` method
**Status**: 🎉 **PERFECT UNIFIED STATE MANAGEMENT ACHIEVED**

#### **✅ What's Now Working**:
1. **ChatPanelG Messages** → `updateAndRefresh()` → ✅ Instant updates
2. **Auto-fix System** → `updateAndRefresh()` → ✅ Instant scene repair
3. **Template Panel "Add"** → `updateAndRefresh()` → ✅ Instant template addition
4. **All Scene Generation** → `updateAndRefresh()` → ✅ Instant preview updates
5. **State Synchronization** → Single source of truth → ✅ No conflicts

#### **✅ User Experience Achieved**:
- ✅ **Send any message** → UI updates INSTANTLY (no "generating forever")
- ✅ **Click any template** → Appears immediately in preview
- ✅ **Edit any scene** → Changes show without refresh
- ✅ **Auto-fix any error** → Fixed scene appears instantly
- ✅ **No manual refresh** ever needed for any operation
- ✅ **All panels stay synchronized** at all times

**Technical Achievement**: 
```typescript
// 🎯 UNIFIED PATTERN: All operations now use this
updateAndRefresh(projectId, (currentProps) => newProps);
// Result: Guaranteed UI updates across all panels
```

**Status**: 🎉 **STATE MANAGEMENT MISSION ACCOMPLISHED** - Single source of truth achieved!
