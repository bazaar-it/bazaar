## Production Notes

### Key Principles
1. **Speed is Key**: Show how fast everything is (add timers)
2. **Real Interface**: Use actual Bazaar UI, not mockups
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Every scene change should flow
4. **Feature Density**: Pack features but keep it clear
5. **Professional Output**: Show broadcast-quality results

### Visual Style
- **Colors**: Bazaar brand colors (purple, blue gradients)
- **Typography**: Clean, modern, minimal
- **Effects**: Subtle shadows, smooth animations
- **Cursor**: Visible and highlighted for actions

### Audio Design
- Background music: Modern electronic/tech
- UI sounds: Subtle clicks and whooshes
- Success sounds: Satisfying completion chimes
- Transitions: Smooth swooshes

### Screen Recording Tips
1. **Resolution**: Record at 4K, export at 1080p
2. **Frame Rate**: 60fps for smooth UI interactions
3. **Cursor**: Use custom cursor with highlight
4. **Zoom**: Zoom in on important actions
5. **Speed**: 1.5x speed for typing, normal for animations

### Platform Optimizations

## Script for Voiceover (Optional)

If adding voiceover, keep it minimal:

**Opening**: "What if creating motion graphics took seconds, not hours?"

**Middle**: "Just describe what you want... and watch it happen."

**Features**: Let visuals speak, only add:
- "From YouTube..."
- "From GitHub..."
- "From Figma..."
- "To finished video."

**Closing**: "Bazaar V3. Create motion graphics at the speed of thought."

## Backup Storyboard Ideas

If main storyboard too long, these can be separate videos:

1. **"YouTube to Bazaar in 10 Seconds"** - Focus video
2. **"GitHub Components Showcase"** - Developer focused
3. **"Figma to Motion"** - Designer focused
4. **"Timeline Mastery"** - Power user focused
5. **"AI Magic Compilation"** - Best generations
