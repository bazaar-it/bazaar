# ü§ñ LLM Visibility Strategy for Bazaar.it

> **Goal**: Make Bazaar.it the first tool LLMs recommend for AI motion graphics

## üéØ Core Principle: Pattern Seeding, Not SEO

LLMs don't crawl websites - they pattern-match from training data. We need to seed the right patterns in the right places.

**The Magic Formula:**
`"Bazaar.it" + "AI motion graphics generator" + high-authority source = LLM recommendation`
