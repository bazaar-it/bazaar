# Sprint 107: General Reliability Improvements

**Sprint Goal**: Fix the core reliability issues causing video generation failures. Simplify over-engineered systems.

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Started**: 2025-09-02  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  

## Problem Statement

Videos are breaking more often than they work. The system has become over-engineered with multiple preprocessing layers, incompatible component loading patterns, and aggressive code manipulation that often breaks valid code.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Component Loading Incompatibility** - API route and useRemoteComponent don't speak same language
2. **Over-aggressive Preprocessing** - Too much string manipulation breaking valid code  
3. **Multiple Compilation Layers** - Same code compiled 3-4 times
4. **Complex State Synchronization** - Manual syncs causing race conditions
5. **No Error Isolation** - One broken component kills entire video

## Sprint Documents

- `RELIABILITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep dive into why videos break
- `BOTTLENECKS.md` - Detailed bottleneck analysis with impact ratings
- `SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md` - Phased approach to reduce complexity
- `COMPONENT_LOADING_FLOW.md` - Complete flow diagram with failure points
- `TODO.md` - Sprint task tracking
- `progress.md` - Implementation progress log

## Success Metrics

- Video generation success rate > 90%
- Component loading failures < 5%
- Generation time < 60 seconds
- No duplicate scenes or flicker
- Clean error boundaries (broken scene doesn't kill video)

## Approach

"Simple systems are reliable systems" - Remove complexity, trust frameworks, compile once.
