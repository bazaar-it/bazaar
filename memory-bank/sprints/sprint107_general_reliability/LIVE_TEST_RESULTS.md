# Sprint 107 - Live Test Results

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Test Environment**: Dev branch, localhost:3000

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Error Boundaries ARE WORKING
- Error properly caught and logged: `[SceneErrorBoundary] Scene 2 crashed`
- Other scenes continue to render
- User sees error message instead of blank screen

### ⚠️ New Issue Found: JSX Compilation Error

#### Error Details:
```
Unexpected token when processing JSX children.
src/app/projects/[id]/generate/workspace/panels/PreviewPanelG.tsx (422:33)
```

#### Root Cause:
The auto-fix attempt created a new syntax error in the scene code:
- Malformed closing of `particles.map()` 
- Has `));` instead of proper JSX closing `})}`

#### Evidence from Logs:
```javascript
// Broken JSX (line truncated in error):
{particles.map((particle, i) => (
  <div ... />
));  // <-- WRONG! Should be })}
```

## What This Proves:

### Our Fixes ARE Working:
1. ✅ **Error Boundaries**: Successfully containing scene failures
2. ✅ **Component Export**: No "module not found" errors seen
3. ✅ **No Import Crashes**: No GET /remotion 404 errors
4. ✅ **System Resilience**: Video continues despite scene error

### Remaining Issues:
1. **Auto-fix Quality**: Sometimes introduces new syntax errors
2. **JSX Compilation**: Sensitive to bracket mismatches
3. **Error Recovery**: Need better validation before applying fixes

## Live Metrics Observed:

### Before Our Fixes:
- Would have seen: Complete video crash
- Would have seen: GET /remotion 404
- Would have seen: Blank screen

### After Our Fixes:
- ✅ Video continues playing
- ✅ Error contained to one scene
- ✅ Clear error message shown
- ✅ No browser crashes

## Recommendations:

### Immediate:
1. The core reliability fixes are working
2. Auto-fix needs better syntax validation
3. Consider adding JSX syntax check before saving

### Next Steps:
1. Monitor production for similar patterns
2. Improve auto-fix JSX handling
3. Add pre-save validation for common syntax errors

## Conclusion:

**The Sprint 107 fixes are successful!** The system is now more resilient:
- Errors are contained (not fatal)
- Components load properly
- No browser crashes from imports

The new JSX syntax error is a separate issue with auto-fix quality, not a failure of our reliability improvements.
