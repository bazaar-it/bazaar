# Sprint 111 — Motion Graphics Principles (Taste Charter)

Purpose: Establish clear, enforceable motion graphics principles for software demo videos that consistently produce premium, comfortable-to-watch results. This sprint documents the Taste Charter, motion laws, composition rules, pro tips, and anti‑patterns to guide single‑step generation.

Scope:
- Generator prompt addendum (single-step; no 2-pass pipeline)
- High‑taste principles encoded as tokens and rules
- Pro effects that add polish without clutter
- Checklists and heuristics for quick evaluation

- Practical “pro tricks” catalog
- Ban list of anti‑patterns
