# Sprint 111 — Progress

## 2025-08-30
- Initialized sprint folder and documentation: principles, pro tips, TODO
- Outlined Taste Charter (tokens, motion laws, composition rules)
- Captured pro effects and anti‑patterns for quick reference
- Attempted a single cohesive cinematic template (portal + morph + camera journey) — rejected for not meeting quality bar. Removed from codebase and registry.
- Next: integrate charter into code-generator prompt and add 3 concise few‑shots
