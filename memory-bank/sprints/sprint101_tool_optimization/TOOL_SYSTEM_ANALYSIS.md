## 📊 Decision Logic Analysis

### Current Decision Tree

```
User Input
    ↓
1. Check for "add new scene" → addScene (OVERRIDE)
2. Check for "for scene X" + image → editScene (OVERRIDE)
3. Analyze intent:
   - Create? → Which creation tool?
   - Modify? → editScene
   - Delete? → deleteScene
   - Duration? → trimScene vs editScene
4. Check for special cases:
   - Website URL → websiteToVideo
   - YouTube URL → Need time specification
   - Audio file → addAudio
   - Figma design → addScene
```

### Key Decision Points

#### 🎯 Strengths
1. **Bias toward action** - Single tool choice, no clarification loops
2. **Fast paths** for non-AI operations (trim, delete, audio)
3. **Clear image handling rules**
4. **Smart scene reference detection**

#### ⚠️ Weaknesses
1. **No learning from failures** - Doesn't track which decisions worked
2. **Context overload** - Sends ALL chat history (no limit!)
3. **Sequential processing** - Can't run multiple tools in parallel
4. **No pattern recognition** - Doesn't learn user preferences
5. **Disabled multi-scene** - Forces sequential addScene calls

## 🚀 Optimization Opportunities

### 1. MAKE IT FASTER

#### A. Parallel Tool Execution
```typescript
// Current: Sequential (60s + 60s = 120s)
"Make scene 1 blue and scene 2 red"
→ editScene(1) → wait → editScene(2)

// Optimized: Parallel (60s total)
→ Promise.all([editScene(1), editScene(2)])
```

**Implementation**: Enable multi-tool execution in orchestrator

#### B. Context Pruning
```typescript
// Current: ALL chat history
chatHistory: recentMessages.reverse() // No limit!

// Optimized: Smart context window
chatHistory: [
  ...lastNMessages(5), // Recent context
  ...relevantMessages(intent), // Intent-specific
  ...sceneReferences // Referenced scenes only
]
```

**Impact**: Reduce token count by 60-80%, faster LLM processing

#### C. Tool Shortcuts
```typescript
// Current: Every audio request goes through brain
"add music" → Brain → addAudio

// Optimized: Direct routing for obvious cases
if (hasAudioFile || /add (music|audio|sound)/i.test(prompt)) {
  return directRoute('addAudio');
}
```

**Tools suitable for shortcuts**:
- addAudio (audio keywords)
- deleteScene (delete keywords + scene ref)
- trimScene (duration keywords + scene ref)

#### D. Response Streaming
```typescript
// Current: Wait for complete generation
Brain → Tool → Complete Code → Response

// Optimized: Stream partial results
Brain → Stream decision → Tool → Stream code → Response
```

### 2. MAKE IT SMARTER

#### A. Decision Confidence Scoring
```typescript
interface BrainDecision {
  toolName: ToolName;
  confidence: number; // 0-1
  alternatives: ToolName[]; // Fallback options
  reasoning: string;
}

// Use confidence for auto-retry logic
if (decision.confidence < 0.7 && hasAlternatives) {
  // Try alternative if first fails
}
```

#### B. User Pattern Learning
```typescript
// Track patterns per user
userPatterns: {
  preferredDuration: 90, // Usually wants 3-second scenes
  commonRequests: ["make it blue", "add particles"],
  toolSuccessRate: { addScene: 0.95, editScene: 0.82 },
  averageSceneCount: 5
}

// Use in decision making
if (userPatterns.commonRequests.includes(normalizedPrompt)) {
  // Fast path with known working approach
}
```

#### C. Re-enable Smart Scene Planning
```typescript
// Instead of disabled scenePlanner, use progressive generation
"Make 3 scenes about coffee"
→ Detect multi-scene intent
→ Generate scene plans (lightweight, no code)
→ Show user the plan
→ Generate scenes in parallel

Benefits:
- User sees immediate progress
- Can stop/modify before full generation
- Parallel generation saves time
```

#### D. Context-Aware Tool Selection
```typescript
// Current: Static rules
if (hasImage) use addScene or editScene

// Optimized: Context-aware
if (hasImage) {
  if (lastToolFailed === 'imageRecreator') {
    use addScene; // Fallback
  } else if (imageComplexity > 0.8) {
    use addScene; // Better for complex
  } else {
    use imageRecreatorScene; // Exact copy
  }
}
```

### 3. QUICK WINS (Implement Today)

#### Win #1: Limit Chat History
```typescript
// In scene-operations.ts line 131
const recentMessages = await db.query.messages.findMany({
  where: eq(messages.projectId, projectId),
  orderBy: [desc(messages.sequence)],
  limit: 20 // ADD THIS - 80% token reduction!
});
```

#### Win #2: Cache Brain Decisions
```typescript
// Cache common patterns
const decisionCache = new Map();
const cacheKey = `${normalizedPrompt}-${sceneCount}`;
if (decisionCache.has(cacheKey)) {
  return decisionCache.get(cacheKey);
}
```

#### Win #3: Tool Metrics Tracking
```typescript
// Add to iteration records
{
  toolName: 'addScene',
  executionTimeMs: 45000,
  tokensUsed: 1500,
  success: true,
  errorCount: 0
}
```

### 4. ADVANCED OPTIMIZATIONS

#### A. Tool Chaining
```typescript
// Define common chains
const chains = {
  'brand-video': ['websiteToVideo', 'addAudio', 'trimScene'],
  'social-post': ['addScene', 'typographyScene', 'trimScene'],
  'product-demo': ['imageRecreatorScene', 'editScene', 'addAudio']
};

// Detect and execute chains
if (detectChainIntent(prompt)) {
  executeChain(chains[intent]);
}
```

#### B. Speculative Execution
```typescript
// Start generating likely next steps
if (currentTool === 'addScene' && scenes.length === 0) {
  // Preload audio selection (users often add music after first scene)
  speculativeLoad('audioLibrary');
}
```

#### C. Model Routing
```typescript
// Use different models for different complexities
const routeModel = (tool: ToolName, complexity: number) => {
  if (complexity < 0.3) return 'gpt-5-mini'; // Simple
  if (complexity < 0.7) return 'claude-haiku'; // Medium
  return 'claude-sonnet-4'; // Complex
};
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why scenePlanner Was Disabled
Looking at the code comment "TOO COMPLEX", the issue was likely:
1. Too many decisions in one LLM call
2. Hard to handle failures in multi-scene generation
3. Users couldn't see/control intermediate steps

### Solution: Progressive Generation
Instead of planning all scenes upfront:
1. Generate high-level plan (fast, cheap)
2. Show plan to user immediately
3. Generate scenes in parallel
4. Allow stop/modify at any point

### The 80/20 Rule
- 80% of requests are simple (add/edit/trim)
- 20% need complex orchestration
- Optimize for the 80% with shortcuts
- Keep full power for the 20%

## 🔬 Metrics to Track

```typescript
interface ToolMetrics {
  toolName: ToolName;
  averageExecutionTime: number;
  successRate: number;
  averageTokensUsed: number;
  commonFailureReasons: string[];
  userSatisfactionRate: number; // From implicit signals
}
```

Track these to identify:
- Which tools need optimization
- Which decisions fail most often
- Where to apply shortcuts
- Model routing opportunities

## 🏁 Conclusion

Your tool system is well-designed but operating at ~40% potential efficiency. The biggest wins:

1. **Immediate**: Limit context (5 min work, 30% speed gain)
2. **High Impact**: Parallel execution (2 hours work, 50% speed gain for multi-ops)
3. **Game Changer**: Progressive multi-scene (4 hours work, enables new workflows)

The disabled scenePlanner shows good judgment - it was too complex. But the need it addressed (multi-scene generation) still exists. Progressive generation with parallel execution solves this elegantly.

Start with Phase 1 quick wins - they're easy and impactful. Then move to parallel execution - it's the biggest bang for buck. Finally, add intelligence features based on actual usage patterns you observe.
