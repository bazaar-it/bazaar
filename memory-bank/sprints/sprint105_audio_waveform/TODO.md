## Technical Tasks

### Setup & Infrastructure
- [ ] Research and evaluate audio libraries (Meyda, DSP.js)
- [ ] Set up WebGL boilerplate and utilities
- [ ] Create performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Design new component architecture

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for audio processing algorithms
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] User experience testing with real audio files

## Success Metrics
- Initial render time: <100ms
- Zoom/scroll performance: 60fps consistent
- Memory usage: 50% reduction for long audio
- Cache hit rate: >90%
- User satisfaction: Improved editing precision

## Notes
- Current implementation uses Canvas 2D with basic waveform generation
- Already have click-to-seek, playhead sync, and basic peak visualization
- Focus on performance first, then add advanced features
- Consider using established libraries (peaks.js, wavesurfer.js) as fallback
