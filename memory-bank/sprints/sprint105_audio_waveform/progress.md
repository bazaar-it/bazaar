# Sprint 105: Audio Waveform Enhancement - Progress Log

## Sprint Start: 2025-09-01

### Initial Analysis Complete
- Reviewed current TimelinePanel implementation
- Identified existing features:
  - Basic waveform generation using Web Audio API
  - Canvas 2D rendering
  - Click-to-seek functionality
  - Playhead synchronization
  - Peak visualization
- Created comprehensive improvement plan with 10 advanced features

### Documentation Created
- `advanced-waveform-improvements.md`: Detailed technical specifications for all 10 improvements
- `TODO.md`: Organized task list with three implementation phases
- Prioritized performance improvements (WebGL, progressive loading, virtual scrolling) for Phase 1

### Key Decisions
- Phase 1 focuses on performance foundation (WebGL, caching, virtualization)
- Phase 2 adds professional editing features (RMS/Peak, transients, scrubbing)
- Phase 3 implements advanced analysis (spectrum, beat detection, stereo tools)
- Each improvement includes detailed technical implementation guidance

### Implementation Complete (2025-09-01)

#### Adaptive Waveform Normalization ✅
- Implemented dynamic amplitude scaling based on visible waveform section
- Automatically adjusts scale to use 90% of vertical space with 10% headroom
- Quiet sections now show clear detail while maintaining relative dynamics
- Works seamlessly with zoom and scroll - recalculates for visible range

#### RMS vs Peak Dual Display ✅  
- Added RMS (Root Mean Square) calculation alongside peak detection
- RMS shown as filled area (perceived loudness)
- Peaks shown as outline (transients and headroom)
- Professional DAW-style visualization showing both audio characteristics
- Different colors: gray fill for RMS, darker outline for peaks

#### Technical Details
- Modified `generateWaveform()` to calculate both peak and RMS values
- Updated state to store both data arrays: `{peak: number[], rms: number[]}`
- Enhanced `drawWaveform()` with dual-layer rendering
- Adaptive normalization applies to both peak and RMS independently

#### Benefits Achieved
- Instantly see audio character without listening
- Identify over-compressed sections (RMS fills peak area)
- Better editing precision in quiet sections
- Professional appearance matching industry standards

### Next Steps
1. Test with various audio files (music, speech, effects)
2. Consider Progressive Resolution Loading for performance
3. Evaluate need for further improvements based on user feedback
