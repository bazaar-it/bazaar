# Progress â€” Sprint 116 Images

Date: 2025-09-08
- Created sprint docs (README, use-cases, design, prompt drafts, TODO).
- Clarified first-principles plan: add/edit only, with Brain-driven imageAction and upload-time metadata.
- Embed path will be minimal (no storytelling); recreate is strict reference-only.

Next:
- Add `imageDirectives` (per-image) to Brain output and parser.
- Implement EditTool branching.
- Replace legacy prompt fragments in add embed path.

Date: 2025-09-08 (later)
- Added modular prompt base (technical guardrails) and mode deltas (embed/recreate); wired into AddTool and EditTool.
- Updated README/design to reflect current status and modular assembly.
- Expanded TODO with detailed, file-level tickets and acceptance criteria for Brain, ContextBuilder, tools, and deletion plan.
