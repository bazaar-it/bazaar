# Sprint 130 Progress Log

## 2025-09-21 – Sprint setup
- Created sprint scaffold and linked prior research (`token-driven-brand-variants.md`, `bulk-brand-customization-workflow.md`).
- Defined scope: theme token refactor, bulk renderer, orchestration UX, QA.

## 2025-09-21 – Dataset + UI entrypoint
- Created initial synthetic dataset (`datasets/brand-personalization-dataset.{md,json}`) with schema + three sample companies.
- Compared UI integration options and recommended dedicated `/projects/[id]/personalize` page (`ui-bulk-personalization-options.md`).

## 2025-09-21 – BrandTheme contract + wireframe
- Expanded dataset to ten synthetic companies covering fintech, health, creative, ecommerce, security, logistics, education, analytics, and venture verticals.
- Added `src/lib/theme/brandTheme.ts` defining the `BrandTheme` interface, defaults, and mapping helper from stored brand profiles.
- Documented `/projects/[id]/personalize` wireframe (`personalize-page-wireframe.md`) with layout, components, and data requirements.

## 2025-09-21 – Personalize route prototype
- Added `/projects/[id]/personalize` page (server + client) with project summary, theme preview, step tabs, and sample targets table.
- Hooked prototype to `BrandTheme` helper and sample dataset; exported minimal dataset download via `public/sample-personalization-targets.json`.

## 2025-09-21 – Automated scene tokenization
- Introduced `project.tokenizeScenes` tRPC mutation that runs scenes through a brand tokenization prompt, recompiles TSX, and updates DB.
- Added `Tokenize scenes` button on the personalize page with real-time status and toasts; no manual code edits required.
- Created `BRAND_TOKENIZER_PROMPT` + `sceneTokenizer.service` to map colors/fonts/logos to theme tokens.

## 2025-09-22 – Tokenization fallback guardrails
- Investigated compilation failures post-tokenization and traced them to missing `BrandTheme` fallback objects in generated scenes, which caused `theme` to be undefined when the personalization runtime was absent.
- Updated the brand tokenizer system prompt to insist on SSR-safe theme retrieval with optional chaining and literal fallbacks.
- Added post-processing in `sceneTokenizer.service` to rewrite any unsafe `const theme = window.BrandTheme...` declarations into a guarded two-line snippet that always provides `{ colors: {}, fonts: {}, assets: {} }` as a final fallback.

## 2025-09-22 – Keep editor source as TSX
- Noticed that after tokenization the Generate workspace showed compiled JS helpers in the code panel, breaking the editing experience and confusing compile status.
- Changed scene mappers (PreviewPanel, WorkspaceContentArea, ChatPanel, auto-fix pipeline) to keep `data.code`/`tsxCode` as the human-editable TSX while exposing precompiled JS via `jsCode` for the preview player.
- Updated preview dedupe hashing to consider both TSX and JS so state refreshes still trigger when either changes.

## 2025-09-22 – Ensure compiler returns components
- `compileSceneToJS` now appends an auto-return for the detected component and `tokenizeScenes` forces a recompilation when existing `jsCode` lacks that return, fixing the undefined component crash in the player.

## 2025-09-22 – Personalize preview controls
- Updated the personalize route badge detection to match optional chaining (`theme?.`) so projects flip to “token-ready” after conversion.
- Added a brand preview toolbar in `PreviewPanelG` that lets admins apply any sample target theme (or reset to default) without devtools hacks, wiring it to the existing dataset and `BrandTheme` runtime.
