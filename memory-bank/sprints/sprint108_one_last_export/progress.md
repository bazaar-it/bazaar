# Sprint 108 - Progress

## 2025-09-02
- Created Sprint 108 docs (README, TODO)
- Decided on Hybrid icon strategy (local → API → placeholder)
- Added runtime Iconify shim; removed Remotion destructure injection
- Installed healthicons support in icon loader; pending npm install
- Implemented robust replacer + post-validation
- Added icon panel badges showing availability
- Redeployed Remotion site multiple times
- Fixed React Error #130 with complete icon replacement solution
- Discovered Function constructor not returning Component issue
- User added explicit return statements
- **NEW ISSUE**: delayRender timeout crash after user's changes

## Current Crisis: delayRender Timeout

After adding explicit return statements to fix component rendering, exports now crash with:
```
A delayRender() was called but not cleared after 28000ms
```

This affects all 5 chunks in the video export, happening in VideoComposition component.

## Next
- Investigate why delayRender is not being cleared
- Check if explicit return broke async loading
- Fix VideoComposition component timeout issue

## 2025-09-12
- Reviewed Sprint 108 docs (README, TODO, STATUS, DIAGNOSIS, REGRESSION_ANALYSIS)
- Verified preprocess appends `return Component;` to scene jsCode
- Added explicit return fallback in `src/remotion/MainCompositionSimple.tsx` after `${executableCode}`
  - Guarantees the Function constructor returns a component even if preprocessing misses it
  - Safe (guarded by `typeof Component !== 'undefined'`)
- Fixed literal Iconify calls not getting inlined:
  - Extended `replace-iconify-icons.ts` to handle:
    - `window.IconifyIcon({...})` and `IconifyIcon({...})` direct calls with literal `icon` → inline SVG via React.createElement('svg', ...)
    - Retains existing React.createElement and JSX paths
  - Expected result: No more white-square placeholders when icon names are literal strings
- Next: Validate deployed Remotion site uses this version and re-test export
  - Redeploy site, update `REMOTION_SERVE_URL` to new deployment
  - Run export and check for any remaining `delayRender()` timeouts in Lambda logs
  - If timeouts persist, inspect for any FontLoader usage or implicit delays in deployed composition
  
- Added documentation: `EXPORT_RELIABILITY_PLAYBOOK.md` with end-to-end reliability plan (constraints, preprocess enforcement, asset strategy, reporting, deployment, and canary tests)

- Deployed new Remotion site:
  - Serve URL: https://remotionlambda-useast1-yb1vzou9i7.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sites/bazaar-icon-robust-20250912/index.html
  - Updated `.env.local` `REMOTION_SERVE_URL` to this URL

- Validation (canary) export via Remotion CLI:
  - Composition: `MainCompositionSimple`
  - Frames: 0–149 (5s @ 30fps), 1920x1080
  - Output: S3 public URL (see CLI output)
  - Result: ✅ Success (mp4 ~266kB)
