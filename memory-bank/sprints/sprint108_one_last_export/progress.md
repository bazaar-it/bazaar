# Sprint 108 - Progress

## 2025-09-02
- Created Sprint 108 docs (README, TODO)
- Decided on Hybrid icon strategy (local → API → placeholder)
- Added runtime Iconify shim; removed Remotion destructure injection
- Installed healthicons support in icon loader; pending npm install
- Implemented robust replacer + post-validation
- Added icon panel badges showing availability
- Redeployed Remotion site multiple times
- Fixed React Error #130 with complete icon replacement solution
- Discovered Function constructor not returning Component issue
- User added explicit return statements
- **NEW ISSUE**: delayRender timeout crash after user's changes

## Current Crisis: delayRender Timeout

After adding explicit return statements to fix component rendering, exports now crash with:
```
A delayRender() was called but not cleared after 28000ms
```

This affects all 5 chunks in the video export, happening in VideoComposition component.

## Next
- Investigate why delayRender is not being cleared
- Check if explicit return broke async loading
- Fix VideoComposition component timeout issue
