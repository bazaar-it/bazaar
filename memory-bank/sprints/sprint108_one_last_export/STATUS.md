# Sprint 108 - Export Status Report

## Date: 2025-09-02

## Current Status: ‚úÖ Exporting reliably with graceful degradations

Exports complete; API icons inline or degrade to placeholders; dynamic icons resolved via runtime map. Scene isolation holds. We now need user‚Äëvisible notification + email payload.

## What's Working ‚úÖ

### 1. Icon Replacement
- Icons are being successfully replaced
- `[Icon Replace] ‚úÖ POST-VALIDATION PASSED: No IconifyIcon references remaining`
- No React Error #130 occurring
- Fallback chain working (local ‚Üí API ‚Üí placeholder)

### 2. Lambda Deployment
- Successfully deployed to: `bazaar-icon-robust-20250902`
- Using correct serve URL: `https://remotionlambda-useast1-yb1vzou9i7.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sites/bazaar-icon-robust-20250902/index.html`
- Site includes runtime IconifyIcon shim as safety net

### 3. Export Process
- Export completes without errors
- Video file is generated successfully
- All 5 scenes are processed

## Remaining Work

### User Notification
- Show a post‚Äëexport summary of degradations (icons/placeholders, missing media, font substitutions)
- Provide a ‚ÄúCopy email to markus@bazaar.it‚Äù with structured diagnostics

#### Evidence from Logs:
```
jsCodeEnd: '...\n}\n// Last expression is returned by Function constructor\nComponent;\n',
hasComponentFunctions: true,
hasExportDefault: false,
hasReturnComponent: false
```

The preprocessing correctly adds `Component;` as the last line (for Function constructor to return it), but the scenes are not rendering.

## Notes
- Function constructor return issue fixed by explicit `return Component;` and site v3/v4 deploys.

### What We Tried
1. ‚úÖ Removed the `try-catch` block from inside the Function constructor body
2. ‚úÖ Redeployed the Remotion site with the fix
3. ‚úÖ Updated the component check to handle both functions and elements

### Current Code Structure
```javascript
// In MainCompositionSimple.tsx
const createComponent = new Function(
  'React', 'AbsoluteFill', ... other params,
  `
    // Setup code...
    ${executableCode}  // This ends with "Component;"
  `
);

// The Function constructor should return the last expression (Component)
const ComponentFactory = createComponent(...args);

if (ComponentFactory) {
  if (typeof ComponentFactory === 'function') {
    return <ComponentFactory />;
  }
  if (React.isValidElement(ComponentFactory)) {
    return ComponentFactory;
  }
}
```

## The Issue

Despite our fixes, the Lambda environment is still not executing the components properly. The Function constructor appears to not be returning the Component as expected.

## Hypothesis

The Lambda environment may be handling the Function constructor differently than expected. The last expression (`Component;`) should be returned, but it appears this isn't happening in the Lambda context.

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

1. **Add explicit return**: Instead of relying on the last expression, we could modify preprocessing to add `return Component;` explicitly
2. **Debug in Lambda**: Add more logging to see what the Function constructor actually returns
3. **Alternative approach**: Consider using `eval()` instead of Function constructor for Lambda compatibility

## Files Modified in This Sprint

### Successfully Updated
- `/src/server/services/render/icon-loader.ts` - Robust three-tier loading
- `/src/server/services/render/replace-iconify-icons.ts` - Post-validation
- `/src/server/api/routers/render.ts` - TypeScript fixes
- `/src/components/IconSearchGrid.tsx` - UI badges
- `/src/remotion/MainCompositionSimple.tsx` - Function constructor fix attempt

### Created
- `/scripts/deploy-remotion-site.js` - Deployment script
- `/src/lib/icons/icon-sets.ts` - Icon availability definitions
- Test files for icon replacement

## Current Impact

- **Icons**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly with fallback chain
- **Export**: ‚úÖ Completes without errors
- **Content**: ‚ùå Shows fallback metadata instead of actual scenes

## Sprint Status: üü° INCOMPLETE

While we've solved the icon robustness issue completely, the scenes are still not rendering their actual content in Lambda. The export completes but shows placeholder content for each scene.
