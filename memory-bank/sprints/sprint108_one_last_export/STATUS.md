# Sprint 108 - Export Status Report

## Date: 2025-09-15

## Current Status: ‚úÖ Exporting reliably; avatars and dynamic icons hardened

Exports complete; avatars render in Lambda via dynamic resolver; icons are scene‚Äëscoped and robust (no throws). Two icon names in the example scene (mdi:galaxy, lucide:comet) are not available in those sets during export; they render placeholders instead of breaking. Scene isolation holds. Next: add user‚Äëvisible ‚ÄúExport Report‚Äù.

## What's Working ‚úÖ

### 1. Icon Replacement (finalized)
- Scene‚Äëscoped runtime: `__ICON_REGISTRY_<sceneSuffix>`, `__RenderIcon_<sceneSuffix>`
- Dynamic usages rewritten to scene renderer; literals inlined to `<svg>`
- Never throws; placeholders for missing glyphs
- `[Icon Replace] ‚úÖ POST-VALIDATION PASSED: No IconifyIcon references remaining`

### 2. Lambda Deployment
- Successfully deployed to: `bazaar-icon-robust-20250902`
- Using correct serve URL: `https://remotionlambda-useast1-yb1vzou9i7.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sites/bazaar-icon-robust-20250902/index.html`
- Site includes runtime IconifyIcon shim as safety net

### 3. Export Process
- Export completes and produces MP4
- All scenes processed; per‚Äëscene preprocess summaries logged

## Remaining Work

### User Notification
- Show a post‚Äëexport summary of degradations (icons/placeholders, missing media, font substitutions)
- Provide a ‚ÄúCopy email to markus@bazaar.it‚Äù with structured diagnostics

#### Evidence from Logs (after fixes):
```
// Each scene reports
hasComponentFunctions: true
hasExportDefault: false
hasReturnComponent: true
```
Default export is now bound to `Component` and we append `return Component;` explicitly.

## Notes
- Function constructor return issue fixed by explicit `return Component;` and binding the default export to `Component` after stripping `export` statements.

### What We Tried
1. ‚úÖ Removed the `try-catch` block from inside the Function constructor body
2. ‚úÖ Redeployed the Remotion site with the fix
3. ‚úÖ Updated the component check to handle both functions and elements

### Runtime Structure
- Preprocess guarantees `const Component = ...` and appends `return Component;`
- Lambda site executes the code and renders the returned component

## Lessons Learned
- Binding and returning the component in preprocess removes ambiguity about the Function constructor‚Äôs last expression.
- Scene‚Äëscoped runtime identifiers prevent rare symbol collisions in large LLM‚Äëgenerated scenes.
- Missing icons must degrade to placeholders; do not error.

## Files Modified in This Sprint

### Successfully Updated
- `/src/server/services/render/icon-loader.ts` - Robust three-tier loading
- `/src/server/services/render/replace-iconify-icons.ts` - Post-validation
- `/src/server/api/routers/render.ts` - TypeScript fixes
- `/src/components/IconSearchGrid.tsx` - UI badges
- `/src/remotion/MainCompositionSimple.tsx` - Function constructor fix attempt

### Created
- `/scripts/deploy-remotion-site.js` - Deployment script
- `/src/lib/icons/icon-sets.ts` - Icon availability definitions
- Test files for icon replacement

## Current Impact

- **Avatars**: ‚úÖ Dynamic lookups resolved and rendered
- **Icons**: ‚úÖ Dynamic + literal supported; placeholders for unknown names
- **Export**: ‚úÖ Completes; scenes render actual content

## Sprint Status: üü¢ STABILIZED (follow‚Äëups pending)

Core reliability issues addressed. Follow‚Äëups: user‚Äëvisible export report and pre‚Äëexport availability gating (auto‚Äëreplace unsupported icons).
