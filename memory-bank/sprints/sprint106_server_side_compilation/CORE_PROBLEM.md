# The ACTUAL Core Problem We're Solving

## It's NOT about share page loading speed
## It's about LLM-generated code reliability

### The Real User Flow That Matters:

1. **User types prompt** in ChatPanelG
2. **Brain orchestrator** selects Add or Edit tool  
3. **Tool generates TSX code** from the prompt
4. **Code goes to PreviewPanelG** 
5. **üí• PROBLEM: Bad code crashes entire video** 

### Current Failure Mode:
```javascript
// LLM generates scene with syntax error
Scene 1: ‚úÖ Works fine
Scene 2: ‚úÖ Works fine  
Scene 3: ‚ùå LLM generated bad code
Result: ENTIRE VIDEO CRASHES - blank preview
```

### What We Need:
```javascript
// With proper compilation & isolation
Scene 1: ‚úÖ Works fine
Scene 2: ‚úÖ Works fine
Scene 3: ‚ùå Shows error placeholder
Result: Video still plays, just Scene 3 shows error
```

## The Solution Path:

### 1. Server-Side Compilation at Generation
When Add/Edit tool generates code:
- Compile TSX‚ÜíJS on server immediately
- If compilation fails, DON'T update the scene
- Return error to user: "Generated code has issues, trying again..."
- LLM can retry with fixed code

### 2. Scene Isolation in Preview
Each scene in its own error boundary:
```jsx
<Sequence>
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<SceneError />}>
    <Scene1 />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</Sequence>
<Sequence>
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<SceneError />}>
    <Scene2 />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</Sequence>
```

### 3. Validation Before Storage
Never store broken code:
- Compile succeeds ‚Üí Store both TSX and JS
- Compile fails ‚Üí Reject the update
- Preview always has working code

## Why This Matters More Than Speed:

**User Experience:**
- Speed issue: "Video takes 3 seconds to load" ‚Üí Annoying
- Reliability issue: "My video is blank/broken" ‚Üí CATASTROPHIC

**Current Reality:**
- 60% success rate means 40% of generations BREAK
- Users lose work, lose trust, leave platform
- One bad scene ruins entire project

**With This Fix:**
- 99% success rate (failures caught before preview)
- Graceful degradation (one scene fails, others work)
- Users can always see their video

## The Priority Stack:

1. **MUST HAVE**: LLM code doesn't crash preview
2. **MUST HAVE**: Scene isolation (bad scene doesn't kill video)
3. **NICE TO HAVE**: Faster share page loading
4. **NICE TO HAVE**: No typing lag in code editor

## Success Metric:

**NOT**: "Share page loads in 500ms"
**BUT**: "User can generate 100 scenes and video never goes blank"
