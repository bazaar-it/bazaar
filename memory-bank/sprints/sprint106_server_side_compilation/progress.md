# Sprint 106 - Progress Log

## Sprint Overview
**Goal**: Consolidate all TSXâ†’JS compilation to server-side  
**Status**: ðŸ”µ PLANNING  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Target Completion**: TBD (10 days estimated)

## 2025-09-02 - Sprint Planning Completed

### Initial Planning âœ…
- Created sprint docs: README, TODO
- Defined target architecture and success criteria
- Planned tickets for compile service, storage, flow integration, and telemetry

### Deep Dive Analysis Completed âœ…
- **CURRENT_STATE.md**: Analyzed 9 compilation points (850+ lines of duplicate code)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Designed server compilation with R2 storage and CDN caching
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Created 5-phase execution plan over 10 days
- **MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md**: Zero-downtime migration with feature flags
- **UX_IMPACT.md**: Documented user experience improvements (50x faster loads)

### Key Discoveries
- **Problem Scale**: 9 different compilation implementations across codebase
- **Performance Impact**: No caching = 500ms recompile on every view
- **Reliability Issues**: Different compilation methods = inconsistent results
- **Solution**: Single server compilation = 95%+ reliability, 10ms cached loads

## 2025-09-02 - APPROACH PIVOT ðŸ”„

### Decision Made: Hybrid Approach
After team discussion and deeper analysis of `render.service.ts`, we discovered:
- Lambda compilation is complex (icon replacement, export stripping, etc.)
- Two compilation targets (browser vs Lambda) would be complicated
- R2 setup adds unnecessary complexity

### New Approach: Hybrid TSX/JS Storage
- **Store both TSX and compiled JS in database**
- **Compile once at generation/edit time**
- **No R2, no CDN, no external dependencies**

### Why Hybrid Is Better
1. **Simpler**: Just database columns, no infrastructure
2. **Faster**: No network round trips
3. **Safer**: Code stays atomic with scene
4. **Cheaper**: No R2 costs
5. **Easier**: One compilation format (browser only)

### Documentation Updated
- **TODO.md**: Completely rewritten for hybrid approach
- **DECISION.md**: Created to document architecture decision
- **Progress**: This update

## Next Steps (Hybrid Approach)
- Add `js_code` column to scenes table
- Create server-side compilation utility
- Integrate with scene creation/editing
- Update preview panels to use pre-compiled JS
- Backfill existing scenes
