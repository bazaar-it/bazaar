# Sprint 106 - Progress Log

## Sprint Overview
**Goal**: Consolidate all TSX‚ÜíJS compilation to server-side  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Phase 1)  
**Start Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Target Completion**: 2025-09-04 (Phase 1)

## 2025-09-02 - Sprint Planning Completed

### Initial Planning ‚úÖ
- Created sprint docs: README, TODO
- Defined target architecture and success criteria
- Planned tickets for compile service, storage, flow integration, and telemetry

### Deep Dive Analysis Completed ‚úÖ
- **CURRENT_STATE.md**: Analyzed 9 compilation points (850+ lines of duplicate code)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Designed server compilation with R2 storage and CDN caching
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Created 5-phase execution plan over 10 days
- **MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md**: Zero-downtime migration with feature flags
- **UX_IMPACT.md**: Documented user experience improvements (50x faster loads)

### Key Discoveries
- **Problem Scale**: 9 different compilation implementations across codebase
- **Performance Impact**: No caching = 500ms recompile on every view
- **Reliability Issues**: Different compilation methods = inconsistent results
- **Solution**: Single server compilation = 95%+ reliability, 10ms cached loads

## 2025-09-02 - APPROACH PIVOT üîÑ

### Decision Made: Hybrid Approach
After team discussion and deeper analysis of `render.service.ts`, we discovered:
- Lambda compilation is complex (icon replacement, export stripping, etc.)
- Two compilation targets (browser vs Lambda) would be complicated
- R2 setup adds unnecessary complexity

### New Approach: Hybrid TSX/JS Storage
- **Store both TSX and compiled JS in database**
- **Compile once at generation/edit time**
- **No R2, no CDN, no external dependencies**

### Why Hybrid Is Better
1. **Simpler**: Just database columns, no infrastructure
2. **Faster**: No network round trips
3. **Safer**: Code stays atomic with scene
4. **Cheaper**: No R2 costs
5. **Easier**: One compilation format (browser only)

### Documentation Updated
- **TODO.md**: Completely rewritten for hybrid approach
- **DECISION.md**: Created to document architecture decision
- **Progress**: This update

## Next Steps (Hybrid Approach)
- Add `js_code` column to scenes table
- Create server-side compilation utility
- Integrate with scene creation/editing
- Update preview panels to use pre-compiled JS
- Backfill existing scenes

## 2025-09-04 ‚Äî Decision Accepted + Documentation Added

### Summary
- Adopted progressive standardization strategy (Strategy 5) for compilation and execution.
- Added documentation: decision record, runtime contract, phased plan, and tickets.

### Files
- `DECISION-RECORD-S106-EXECUTION-MODEL.md`
- `RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md`
- `PHASED-PLAN.md`
- `TICKETS.md`

### Immediate Implementation Plan (Pending Approval)
- Remove wrapper alias consts (IconifyIcon/Icon) in `PreviewPanelG` composite generation.

## 2025-09-04 ‚Äî End-to-End Validation (Export Works!)

### What This Proves
- ‚úÖ Server-side compilation is active: all scenes have `js_compiled_at`
- ‚úÖ Correct pattern preserved: top-level `const { ... } = window.Remotion` remains
- ‚úÖ Compiler behavior confirmed: export stripping + auto-added `return ComponentName;`
- ‚úÖ Wrapper fix effective: no duplicate destructures injected
- ‚úÖ Templates stable: multiple template scenes coexist without conflicts
- ‚úÖ Export success: Lambda export completed and downloaded successfully

### Evidence (from DB and runtime)
- Project scenes: 4 (incl. 2 templates, 1 generated) with frame counts 430/240/135/90
- TSX vs JS diff: JS contains auto-return; TSX remains clean
- `js_compiled_at` timestamps within milliseconds of creation

### Impact
- End-to-end pipeline: Create ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Export now reliable
- Eliminates ‚ÄúIdentifier already declared‚Äù regressions and 35s regeneration pain
- Confirms Phase 1 architecture and wrapper changes fixed the root cause

### Next
- Proceed to Phase 2 planning (standardized artifacts, metrics, background backfill) after short monitoring window.

### Documentation Added (Testing & Runbook)
- `TESTING-CHECKLIST.md`: Hands-on steps for create ‚Üí preview ‚Üí export + edge cases
- `ARCHITECTURE-EXPLAINER.md`: What changed, why it works, and runtime path
- `RUNBOOK-COMPILATION-ISSUES.md`: Triage guide for preview/export failures
 - `EXPLAINER-ONE-PAGER.md`: Executive 1‚Äëpager for sharing
 - `DEMO-SCRIPT.md`: 5‚Äì7 minute demo outline
 - `VERIFICATION-QUERIES.md`: Copy‚Äëpaste SQL to validate `js_compiled_at` and counts
- `PHASE2-ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA.md`: Docs‚Äëonly acceptance criteria for next phase

### Tests Added (Phase 1 assurances)
- `src/server/services/compilation/__tests__/scene-compiler.phase1.test.ts`
  - Appends auto-return for Function constructor
  - Renames colliding identifiers with sceneId suffix
- `src/lib/video/__tests__/wrapSceneNamespace.phase1.test.ts`
  - No duplicate Remotion destructuring injected
  - Uses `var` for duplicate-safe namespace
  - Correctly remaps `useCurrentFrame` with startOffset

## 2025-09-04 ‚Äî Phase 2 Scoping Started

### Scope & Plans Added
- `PHASE2-SCOPE.md`: Objectives, deliverables, risks, milestones
- `PHASE2-ROLL-OUT-CHECKLIST.md`: Dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod steps, verification, rollback
- `PHASE2-MIGRATION-PLAN.md`: Dev-first ADD COLUMN plan + validation and backfill
- `TICKETS-PHASE2.md`: Concrete tasks with effort/risk notes

### Notes
- No code or migrations applied yet. Docs-first only on branch `feat/sprint106-server-compilation-phase1`.
- Keep only global fallback for `window.IconifyIcon` (idempotent).
- Normalize icons in client slow-path (mirror server compiler).
- Add metrics for slow-path usage and precompiled coverage.

## 2025-09-04 ‚Äî Phase 1 Implementation Started

### Changes (Code)
- PreviewPanelG: Removed top-level alias consts for `IconifyIcon`/`Icon` in generated composite code; kept only idempotent global fallback for `window.IconifyIcon`.
- PreviewPanelG: Added icon normalization in slow-path TSX compilation to mirror server compiler (JSX + `React.createElement`).
- PreviewPanelG: Added basic console metrics: precompiled vs slow-path counts, errors, runs per composition.

### Next
- Validate PromptUI renders without collisions in new projects (landscape/portrait).
- Monitor metrics locally and document results.
