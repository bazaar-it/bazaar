# Sprint 106: Implementation Progress

## Date: 2025-01-03

### ✅ Phase 1: Unified Compilation Service - COMPLETE

#### What We Built
Created `SceneCompilerService` at `/src/server/services/compilation/scene-compiler.service.ts` implementing the permissive compilation strategy learned from the 35-second reality.

#### Key Features Implemented

1. **Permissive Validation**
   - NEVER triggers regeneration (respects 35-second constraint)
   - Compiles everything it can
   - Creates safe fallbacks for compilation failures
   - Always returns something usable

2. **Automatic Conflict Resolution**
   ```typescript
   // Detects duplicate identifiers across scenes
   const Button = () => {...}  // Scene 1
   const Button = () => {...}  // Scene 2
   // Auto-fixes to:
   const Button_abc12345 = () => {...}  // Scene 2 (namespaced)
   ```

3. **Safe Fallback Generation**
   - When compilation fails, generates a fallback component
   - Shows error message in a styled container
   - Prevents white screens and crashes
   - User sees something instead of nothing

4. **Three-Layer Strategy Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Layer 1: Generation (PERMISSIVE)
   compileScene() {
     // Try compile → Auto-fix conflicts → Fallback if needed
     // ALWAYS return something
   }
   
   // Layer 2: Runtime (ISOLATED - already working)
   // ErrorBoundary + IIFE isolation
   
   // Layer 3: Export (STRICT - not yet implemented)
   // Will validate for final output quality
   ```

### ✅ Phase 2: Integration with Scene Creation - COMPLETE

#### Files Updated
1. `/src/server/api/routers/generation/helpers.ts`
   - Replaced `compileSceneToJS` with `sceneCompiler.compileScene`
   - Added context-aware compilation with existing scenes
   - All scene creation paths now use unified service:
     - Add scene
     - Edit scene  
     - Image recreation
     - Fallback generation
     - Website to video

2. `/src/server/api/routers/generation/template-operations.ts`
   - Templates now compiled with conflict detection
   - Auto-fixes naming conflicts with existing scenes

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Before: Simple compilation, no conflict detection
const compilationResult = compileSceneToJS(tsxCode);

// After: Context-aware compilation with auto-fixing
const compilationResult = await sceneCompiler.compileScene(tsxCode, {
  projectId,
  sceneId,
  existingScenes  // Pass all scenes for conflict detection
});
```

### 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Zero Regeneration Architecture**
   - Compilation NEVER triggers regeneration
   - Respects the 35-second constraint absolutely
   - Auto-fixes problems instead of rejecting

2. **Unified Compilation Point**
   - Single service handles all compilation
   - Consistent behavior across the app
   - From 9 compilation points → 1

3. **Multi-Scene Safety**
   - Automatically detects and fixes conflicts
   - No more duplicate identifier crashes
   - Scenes work individually AND together

4. **Always Something Renders**
   - Compilation success → Normal scene
   - Compilation failure → Fallback scene
   - Never white screens

### 📊 Expected Impact

- **Regeneration Rate**: Should drop from ~30% to 0%
- **User Wait Time**: Never more than 35 seconds
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ scenes compile (rest use fallback)
- **Multi-Scene Projects**: 100% conflict resolution

### 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Projects** (In Progress)
   - Create multi-scene projects
   - Verify conflict resolution works
   - Monitor for regenerations

2. **Migrate ShareVideoPlayerClient** (Pending)
   - Biggest performance win
   - 3-5s load → <500ms
   - Use pre-compiled JS

3. **Monitor Metrics** (Pending)
   - Track regeneration rate
   - Measure compilation success
   - Document any edge cases

### 🚀 How to Test

```bash
# Server is running on http://localhost:3000

# Test multi-scene conflict resolution:
1. Create a project
2. Add scene with: "Create a Button component that pulses"
3. Add another scene with: "Create a Button component that rotates"
4. Both should work without conflicts (Button → Button_sceneid)

# Test compilation fallback:
1. Generate a scene with intentionally broken syntax
2. Should see styled fallback instead of white screen
3. Check console for compilation error details
```

### 📝 Technical Notes

- Compilation happens server-side during scene creation
- TSX and JS are both stored in database
- JS is used for preview (faster)
- TSX is source of truth (editable)
- Conflicts are fixed silently without user intervention
- Fallback scenes use React.createElement (no JSX)

### ⚠️ Important Reminders

- NEVER reject code for minor issues
- ALWAYS store something (even with errors)
- AUTO-FIX what we can
- TRUST the LLM (it's actually pretty good)
- The 35-second generation time is SACRED

## Summary

Successfully implemented the core permissive compilation strategy that respects the 35-second constraint. The system now auto-fixes conflicts, provides fallbacks, and NEVER triggers regeneration. All scene creation paths have been updated to use the unified compilation service.

The foundation is solid. Next step is testing with real multi-scene projects to verify the conflict resolution works as expected.

## 2025-09-04 — Hotfix: Icon Runtime Crashes in Preview

### Issue
- Scenes and templates using icons crashed at runtime in preview, triggering autofix.
- Root causes:
  - Some scenes referenced `IconifyIcon` (bare) instead of `window.IconifyIcon`.
  - Precompiled JS could still contain ESM `import` lines, invalid inside the concatenated preview module.

### Changes
- Server compiler (`scene-compiler.service.ts`):
  - Normalize icons: rewrite `<IconifyIcon/>` and `<Icon/>` to `<window.IconifyIcon/>`; same for `React.createElement` calls.
  - Strip imports for libs provided via globals (react/remotion/@iconify/react/etc.).
- Preview (`PreviewPanelG.tsx`):
  - Provide local aliases `const IconifyIcon = window.IconifyIcon; const Icon = window.IconifyIcon;` in both single and multi-scene composites.
  - When using precompiled JS, strip any `import` lines in addition to export removals.

### Expected Outcome
- Icon usage no longer crashes scenes in preview.
- Autofix no longer gets triggered by icon-related runtime errors.
- Templates that use icons render normally.
