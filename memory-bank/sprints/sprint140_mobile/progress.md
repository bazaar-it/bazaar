# Progress â€” Sprint 140 Mobile

## 2025-09-25
- Created sprint folder with overview, outline, and TODO to consolidate mobile roadmap.
- Captured current landing page + workspace gaps referencing existing implementations for context.
- Defined success metrics, workstreams, and instrumentation requirements ahead of design/engineering kick-off.

Next:
- Validate baseline analytics for mobile funnel and workspace usage.
- Draft wireframes for mobile hero, chat composer, and timeline drawer concepts.

## 2025-09-26
- Implemented mobile navigation overhaul: bottom nav state now persists per project with haptic feedback and quick action cluster post-generation. Linked implementation details in `navigation-wayfinding-analysis.md`.
- Added floating timeline drawer and fullscreen preview trigger to keep post-generation actions within thumb reach.
- Delivered breadcrumb-driven project switcher across desktop and mobile headers so users can swap projects in-place without leaving the workspace.

Next:
- Evaluate chat input focus hand-off from quick actions to further reduce taps.
- Add analytics events for quick action + breadcrumb interactions once instrumentation workstream is ready.
