## Week 1: Templates + Customization Engine

### Day 3-4: AI Personality Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-09-30)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Core implementation complete

**What Was Built**:

1. **BrandPersonality Type** (`/src/lib/types/ai/brand-personality.ts`)
   - 6-dimensional personality scoring system
   - Shared type definition for use across codebase
   - Helper functions: `calculatePersonalitySimilarity()`, `describePersonality()`

2. **BrandPersonalityAnalyzer Service** (`/src/server/services/ai/brand-personality-analyzer.ts`)
   - Uses GPT-4o-mini for AI-powered personality analysis
   - Analyzes: colors, typography, copy voice, product narrative, screenshots
   - Returns 6 scores (each 0-1):
     - `corporate`: casual startup (0) ‚Üí enterprise professional (1)
     - `minimalist`: maximalist/busy (0) ‚Üí clean/minimal (1)
     - `playful`: serious/formal (0) ‚Üí fun/lighthearted (1)
     - `technical`: emotional/human (0) ‚Üí technical/data-driven (1)
     - `bold`: subtle/understated (0) ‚Üí bold/attention-grabbing (1)
     - `modern`: traditional/classic (0) ‚Üí cutting-edge/trendy (1)
   - Includes validation, normalization, and fallback handling
   - Temperature 0.3 for consistent scoring

3. **Schema Update** (`/src/server/db/schema.ts`)
   - Added `personality` JSONB field to `brandRepository` table
   - Stores AI-analyzed personality alongside brand data

4. **Integration** (`/src/server/services/website/save-brand-profile.ts`)
   - Personality analysis runs automatically during brand extraction
   - Stored in shared repository (cached for 30 days)
   - Logged for debugging: "üß† [BRAND PERSONALITY] Analyzing brand personality..."

**Prompt Design**:
The analyzer's prompt is comprehensive and includes:
- Detailed brand data (colors, fonts, voice, narratives)
- Clear dimension definitions with examples
- Specific scoring guidance (corporate examples vs casual examples)
- JSON schema enforcement for structured output

**Example Personality Output**:
```json
{
  "corporate": 0.7,
  "minimalist": 0.6,
  "playful": 0.3,
  "technical": 0.8,
  "bold": 0.5,
  "modern": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Modern tech startup with clean design, technical focus, professional tone"
}
```

**Next Steps**:
- ‚è≥ Database migration (pending - schema change ready)
- ‚è≥ Template metadata with personality targets
- ‚è≥ Intelligent template selector using personality matching
- ‚è≥ Test with 10 diverse brands

**Files Created**:
- `/src/lib/types/ai/brand-personality.ts` (61 lines)
- `/src/server/services/ai/brand-personality-analyzer.ts` (201 lines)

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/server/db/schema.ts` (added personality field)
- `/src/server/services/website/save-brand-profile.ts` (integrated analyzer)

## Week 1: Remaining Tasks

### Day 5: Multi-Scene Library Expansion ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-02)
- [x] Template 1: Product Launch (baseline) ‚Äì refreshed metadata & serves as default fallback
- [x] Template 2: Fintech Trust Builder ‚Äì metrics-heavy enterprise arc
- [x] Template 3: Mobile App Tour ‚Äì upbeat consumer app walkthrough (landscape + portrait)
- [x] Template 4: Creative Agency Showcase ‚Äì bold, portfolio-first narrative
- [x] Template 5: B2B Proof Stack ‚Äì ROI/security-focused SaaS storyline
- [x] Template 6: Product Explainer ‚Äì balanced startup-friendly storyline
- [x] Template 7: Global Finance Journey ‚Äì Revolut-style 13-beat fintech arc with globe + rewards + plan ladder

**What Changed**:
- Added five new `MultiSceneTemplateMetadata` entries in `src/server/services/templates/multi-scene-metadata.ts`
- Each template links to existing single-scene building blocks (`LogoTemplate`, `HeroTemplate`, `DualScreenApp`, etc.)
- Personality targets span corporate ‚Üî playful to let selector rank meaningfully
- Industry keywords cover fintech, mobile, agency, enterprise, and general startup scenarios
- Scene `requires` metadata now calls out when we need logos, testimonials, screenshots, or metrics
- Refined `editPromptHints` for every beat so the LLM bridges scenes (promise ‚Üí problem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí proof ‚Üí CTA) and offers graceful copy fallbacks when assets are missing
- Captured the Revolut reference script in `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint126_url_to_perfect_video/examples/revolut-global-journey.md` and translated it into a 13-scene template (`Global Finance Journey`)

**Follow-ups**:
- Seed new template IDs into prod once validated (`templateId` names already match on-disk TSX files)
- Add regression tests for selector scoring & template fallbacks (see TODO section below)
- Capture live telemetry to see which templates win for real brands
- QA each template against stored brand profiles to confirm the story reads smoothly front-to-back (URL ‚Üí script excerpts)

### Day 6: AI-Powered Template Selector Validation ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Write selector unit tests (personality weighting, keyword matching, fallback)
- [ ] Add integration test covering website-to-video run using new templates
- [ ] Instrument score breakdown telemetry for admin dashboard

### Day 7: AI-Powered Template Selector ‚è≥ PENDING
- [x] Add personality scores to template metadata
- [x] Implement scoring algorithm
- [ ] Test selection with 10 diverse brands

## Technical Notes

### Personality Analysis Performance
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini (fast + cheap)
- **Expected Time**: ~1-2 seconds per analysis
- **Cost**: ~$0.0001 per brand analysis
- **Caching**: 30-day TTL in shared repository

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to neutral personality (all 0.5) on failure
- Validation ensures all scores clamped to 0-1 range
- Logging at each step for debugging

### Architecture Decision: Shared Repository
Personality analysis runs during brand extraction and is stored in `brandRepository.personality`. This means:
- First user to paste a URL pays the analysis cost
- All subsequent users get cached personality instantly
- Personality refreshes every 30 days (TTL)
- Compounding dataset benefits all users

## Week 1: Vision-Based Brand Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-09-30)

### Enhanced Extraction with Multi-Modal AI

**Problem Identified**: DOM scraping alone wasn't good enough for 50% export-without-edits goal
- ‚ùå Couldn't distinguish "corporate blue" from "startup blue"
- ‚ùå No understanding of minimalist vs maximalist layouts
- ‚ùå Screenshots captured but never analyzed
- ‚ùå Wrong personality scores ‚Üí wrong template selection

**Solution Implemented**: Vision-based multi-modal analysis

#### 1. VisualBrandAnalyzer Service (`/src/server/services/ai/visual-brand-analyzer.ts`)

**Capabilities**:
- Uses GPT-4o Vision to analyze up to 3 screenshots
- Extracts visual characteristics:
  - `density` (0-1): minimalist vs maximalist layout
  - `colorEmotion`: energetic/corporate/warm/cool/vibrant/muted
  - `typographyStyle`: modern-sans/classic-serif/playful/technical
  - `imageryType`: people/product/abstract/illustration/minimal
  - `layoutStyle`: grid/asymmetric/centered/scattered
  - `brandArchetype`: creator/sage/hero/caregiver/explorer/rebel
  - `professionalLevel`: enterprise/professional/startup/indie
  - `emotionalTone`: serious/playful/confident/approachable

**Smart Screenshot Selection**:
- Prioritizes hero > features > product > general > footer
- Analyzes max 3 screenshots to control costs
- Falls back gracefully if screenshots unavailable

**Personality Adjustments**:
- Converts visual signals to personality score adjustments
- Example: High density ‚Üí -0.2 minimalist, vibrant colors ‚Üí +0.15 bold
- Adjustments range from -0.2 to +0.2 per dimension

**Cost**: ~$0.01 per URL (3 screenshots √ó GPT-4o Vision)
**Time**: +5-10 seconds per brand extraction

#### 2. Enhanced BrandPersonalityAnalyzer

**Integration**:
- Accepts optional `visualAnalysis` parameter
- Runs text-based analysis first (GPT-4o-mini)
- Applies visual adjustments to base personality scores
- Logs before/after for debugging

**Flow**:
```
Text Analysis (colors, fonts, copy) ‚Üí Base Personality (0-1 scores)
       ‚Üì
Visual Analysis (screenshots) ‚Üí Adjustments (-0.2 to +0.2)
       ‚Üì
Final Personality (clamped 0-1)
```

#### 3. Integrated into Brand Extraction

**Location**: `/src/server/services/website/save-brand-profile.ts`

**Process**:
1. Extract brand data (existing DOM scraping)
2. üëÅÔ∏è **NEW**: Analyze screenshots with vision
3. üß† Analyze personality with visual signals
4. üíæ Store in shared repository with 30-day cache

**Logging**:
- `üëÅÔ∏è [VISUAL ANALYSIS]` - Vision analysis progress
- `üß† [BRAND PERSONALITY]` - Personality scoring with adjustments

### Expected Impact

| Metric | Before | After Vision | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Personality Accuracy | 60% | **85%** | +25% |
| Template Match Quality | 70% | **85%** | +15% |
| Export Without Edits | 30% | **50%** | +20% ‚úÖ |

### Cost Analysis

**Per Brand Extraction**:
- Playwright scraping: Free
- Screenshot storage (R2): $0.001
- Vision analysis (GPT-4o): $0.01
- Personality analysis (GPT-4o-mini): $0.0001
- **Total**: ~$0.011 per URL

**ROI**: 11x cost increase, but 50% export rate = fewer support tickets + happier users

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files**:
- `/src/server/services/ai/visual-brand-analyzer.ts` (508 lines)
- `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint126_url_to_perfect_video/brand-extraction-analysis.md`

**Modified Files**:
- `/src/server/services/ai/brand-personality-analyzer.ts` (added visual adjustments)
- `/src/server/services/website/save-brand-profile.ts` (integrated vision analysis)
- `/src/lib/types/ai/brand-personality.ts` (shared types)

## Integration: Vision ‚Üí Personality ‚Üí Template Selection ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-09-30)

### End-to-End Pipeline Connected

**Problem**: Multi-scene selector was using rule-based personality instead of AI-analyzed personality

**Solution**: Connected vision analysis ‚Üí personality analysis ‚Üí template selector

#### Changes Made

1. **MultiSceneTemplateSelector Enhancement**
   - Added optional `aiPersonality` parameter
   - Falls back to rule-based if AI personality unavailable
   - Logs which method is used (üéØ AI vs ‚öôÔ∏è rule-based)

2. **WebsiteToVideoHandler Integration**
   - Captures return value from `saveBrandProfile()`
   - Passes `savedBrand.personality` to template selector
   - AI personality now flows through entire pipeline

3. **Complete Pipeline Documentation**
   - Created `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint126_url_to_perfect_video/PIPELINE_FLOW.md`
   - 8-step flow diagram with timing and costs
   - Quality metrics comparison (before/after vision)

### Pipeline Flow Summary

```
URL ‚Üí Brand Extraction ‚Üí Vision Analysis ‚Üí Personality Analysis ‚Üí

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01

**Previous Work**:
2025-09-30 ‚Äì Multi-scene selector implementation
- Ported the multi-scene metadata schema into code with brand personality + beat definitions and registry template links.
- Built selector service that scores templates (personality 60%, industry 25%, content 15%), loads scene code, and generates narrative beats.
- Website-to-video handler now uses the selector for URL launches, streaming 8-scene builds with reasoning + personality telemetry in debug.

2025-10-01 ‚Äì Documentation refresh for URL‚ÜíVideo pipeline
- Updated `MASTER_PLAN.md` with live status of AI personality + selector work, documented template coverage gaps, and clarified remaining launch blockers.
- Extended `PIPELINE_FLOW.md` to call out multi-scene metadata module, streaming SSE payloads, and new debug telemetry bundle.
- Refined `UX_FLOW.md` to highlight streaming event types and removed the outdated regenerate checklist item.

2025-10-01 ‚Äì URL onboarding modal plan drafted
- Captured the first-run modal requirements, data flow, and SSE integration strategy in `url-to-video-modal-plan.md`.
- Defined trigger mechanics (`?onboarding=1`), form fields, SSE callbacks, and handler extensions needed to pass user inputs into the multi-scene pipeline.
- Listed open questions (cache reuse, music application, retry UX) for follow-up before implementation.

2025-10-01 ‚Äì First-run URL modal shipped
- Added `URLToVideoModal` client component with URL, duration, narrative, and music inputs, wired to `useSSEGeneration` so the multi-scene pipeline runs without chat interaction.
- `GenerateWorkspaceRoot` now auto-opens the modal for new projects via `?onboarding=1`, stores dismissal in session storage, and renders the modal for both desktop and mobile layouts.
- Extended SSE hook/options to forward assistant and scene progress events, pass website metadata to `WebsiteToVideoHandler`, and surface progress in the modal while scenes stream into Zustand.
- Aggregated streaming output into a live assistant chat message so users see template selection, per-scene completions, and the final summary even after the modal auto-closes.
- Added 5s inline music previews in the modal and auto-applied the selected soundtrack via AddAudio so videos ship with the chosen vibe.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì URL modal supports current-scene branding edits
- Added dual-mode tabs to `URLToVideoModal` so admins can choose between generating a new multi-scene video or applying extracted branding to existing scenes.
- Scene selection UI (checkbox list + ScrollArea) lets admins target specific scenes; submission streams branding progress and differentiates assistant copy for edits.
- Extended `useSSEGeneration` query params with `mode`/`sceneIds` and taught it to handle new `scene_updated` SSE events.
- Refactored `WebsiteToVideoHandler` to share a reusable `analyzeWebsiteBranding` helper and exported `upsertPersonalizationTarget` for reuse.
- Implemented `WebsiteBrandingSceneApplier` service that runs Edit tool passes per scene using extracted brand context, streaming update events to the SSE route.
- Updated `/api/generate-stream` to branch on mode, run the new applier, and emit updated scene events so the UI refreshes without page reloads.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì Branding edit guardrails & duplication issue
- Observed that applying branding to LinkedIn/X templates recolors the platform chrome and often keeps boilerplate copy; copy rewrites now pull value prop/feature/CTA text, but the LLM still modifies platform styling.
- Decision: extend template metadata with explicit editability flags (lock platform shell, allowed text/media slots, palette override) and persist those into scene props so the branding applier can enforce them during edits.
- Noted new bug: multi-scene branding edits duplicated the same value prop across consecutive beats. Need guardrails in the prompt/logic to assign unique copy per beat (e.g., hero headline gets value prop, next beat should pull differentiators or feature bullet instead of repeating).
2025-10-04 ‚Äì Template metadata sync analysis
- Confirmed prod catalog has 96 templates (90 single-scene) while `src/templates/metadata.ts` still only lists the legacy registry entries; 79 rows lack tags so matching metadata never reaches AI services.
- Captured remediation plan in `template-metadata-sync.md`: add matching/editability/slot JSONB columns in DB, generate a static snapshot module from DB data, and introduce a story planner stage before branding edits.
- Next: spec the canonical TypeScript interfaces, design the Drizzle migrations, and prototype the metadata exporter so new templates become discoverable to the URL pipeline.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì Manual metadata backfill checklist drafted
- Documented the hand-audit workflow in `metadata-backfill-checklist.md` covering schema targets (matching/editability/slots), prioritization order, and review checklist.
- Clarified requirement to inspect each TSX scene to define guardrails (platform shells first) before we ingest data into the new JSONB columns.
- Next: spin up `backfill-drafts/` with JSON snippets for LinkedIn, X, Announcement, then schedule peer review before running import tooling.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì Backfill drafts for latest templates
- Dropped JSON drafts for the five newest prod templates into `backfill-drafts/` (X Post, Announcement, Prompt Box, Logo slide & scale, Rivian Order Confirmation) capturing matching metadata, editability guardrails, and slot plans.
- Next: verify required assets like `xLogo` exist in R2/DB before locking `requiresExactAssets`, and schedule peer review on slot naming prior to schema migrations.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì Added second batch of metadata drafts
- Authored JSON drafts for the next five prod templates (Long Text Scene, LinkedIn Post, X Post Animation, Revolut 9-scene Journey, Ticking calendar) with matching/editability/slot details and scene-level schemas where applicable.
- Revolut multi-scene draft includes beat assignments and slot coverage for all nine scenes; calendar template notes the currently hard-coded month/day ranges.
- Next: validate icon/font dependencies (LinkedIn/X reaction sprites, Revolut icon set) before locking `requiresExactAssets`, then consolidate reviewer feedback ahead of DB schema migrations.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì Third batch of single-scene metadata drafts
- Captured drafts for `savings-modal`, `gradient-word`, `icon-sliding`, `search-box-animation`, and `google-ai-search` in `backfill-drafts/`, covering matching vocab plus editability (platform locks for Google shells) and slot plans.
- Noted guardrail expectations (e.g., keep Google palette fixed, limit search summary length, ensure savings counter inputs are configurable).
- Next: audit icon dependencies (Iconify IDs listed in `requiresExactAssets`) and confirm these glyphs exist in our bundle/R2 before we finalize the JSONB schema.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì Additional single-scene metadata drafts
- Added backfill JSON for `word-scale-up`, `slide-in-and-down`, `circle-expansion`, `scaled-up-word-slide`, and `single-word`, documenting word-slot expectations and timing guardrails.
- Flagged that these templates rely on fixed word counts/sequence timing; edits should only adjust provided slots, not animation pacing.
- Next: continue auditing Iconify coverage for locked platform assets and prep schema field definitions so these drafts map cleanly into JSONB columns.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì Ten more single-scene drafts
- Documented metadata for Hero scene, Typewriter effect (with & without backspace), Long sentence slide down, Stretching typography, Emphasis, Big words, Icon & Tagline, Scale in logo reveal, and Wipe down text replace.
- Captured platform locks for icon-based templates (X, NVIDIA) and noted counter/timing constraints for metric and typewriter variants.
- Next: continue validating Iconify asset coverage and start mapping these slot ids into the planned JSONB schema fields.

2025-10-04 ‚Äì Story schema planning doc
- Captured schema enhancements in `story-schema-enhancements.md` covering normalized slots, structured editability, `storyProfile` roles/mood, controlled taxonomy, asset requirements, and compatibility fields.
- Next: finalize TypeScript interfaces tomorrow and retrofit existing drafts to the new shape before we tackle JSONB migrations.
