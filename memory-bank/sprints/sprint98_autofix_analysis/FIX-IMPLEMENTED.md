# AUTO-FIX SYSTEM CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

**Date**: 2025-08-26
**Issue**: Infinite loop of auto-fix attempts causing excessive API costs

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Duplicate Hook Usage** 
Both `ChatPanelG` AND `PreviewPanelG` were using the `useAutoFix` hook, creating duplicate event listeners and causing the same error to be processed twice.

### 2. **Cross-Project Contamination**
When switching between projects, old event listeners weren't properly cleaned up, causing errors from previous projects to trigger fixes in the new project.

### 3. **No Error Deduplication**
The system would repeatedly attempt to fix the same error without tracking what had already been attempted.

### 4. **Insufficient Rate Limiting**
API calls were happening too frequently without proper cooldown between attempts.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Removed Duplicate Hook Usage
**File**: `src/app/projects/[id]/generate/workspace/panels/PreviewPanelG.tsx`
- Removed `useAutoFix` hook from PreviewPanelG
- Only ChatPanelG now handles auto-fix logic
- PreviewPanelG only dispatches error events

### 2. Added Project ID Tracking
**File**: `src/hooks/use-auto-fix.ts`
- Added `currentProjectIdRef` to track active project
- Event handlers now verify events are for current project
- Prevents cross-project error contamination

### 3. Implemented Error Signature Tracking
- Added `fixedErrorSignatures` Set to track attempted fixes
- Generates normalized error signatures to detect duplicates
- Prevents fixing the same error repeatedly

### 4. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- Reduced `MAX_FIXES_PER_SESSION` from 10 to 5
- Reduced `MAX_FIXES_PER_SCENE` from 3 to 2
- Added `MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_FIXES_MS` (10 seconds minimum)
- Increased debounce time from 2s to 5s
- Increased cooldown period from 1 minute to 2 minutes

### 5. Improved Cleanup on Project Switch
- Clear all queues when project changes
- Reset all state (cooldown, failures, circuit breaker)
- Clear error signature tracking
- Remove all event listeners and timers

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenario 1: Project Switching
1. Open project with compilation error
2. Let auto-fix trigger
3. Switch to different project
4. Verify no fixes from old project occur

### Test Scenario 2: Error Deduplication
1. Create scene with error
2. Verify only one fix attempt occurs
3. If error persists, verify max 2 attempts total

### Test Scenario 3: Rate Limiting
1. Create multiple scenes with errors
2. Verify 10-second minimum between fixes
3. Verify cooldown after 5 fixes in 5 minutes

## Monitoring

Enable debug logging temporarily to monitor behavior:
```typescript
const DEBUG_AUTOFIX = true; // Currently enabled for monitoring
```

Watch for these log messages:
- `[SILENT FIX] Ignoring error from different project` - Good, prevents cross-contamination
- `[SILENT FIX] Already attempted to fix this exact error` - Good, prevents duplicates
- `[SILENT FIX] Too soon since last fix attempt` - Good, rate limiting working
- `[SILENT FIX] ðŸ§¹ FULL CLEANUP` - Good, proper cleanup on project switch

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor for 24 hours** with debug logging enabled
2. **Track API costs** to ensure reduction
3. **Consider implementing persistent error history** in database
4. **Add metrics tracking** for success/failure rates
5. **Disable debug logging** once stable

## Cost Savings Estimate

With these fixes:
- **Before**: Up to 100+ API calls per error (infinite loop)
- **After**: Maximum 2 API calls per unique error
- **Estimated savings**: 98% reduction in auto-fix API costs

## Emergency Kill Switch

### Multiple Ways to Disable Auto-Fix:

#### 1. Browser Console (Runtime Toggle)
```javascript
// To disable auto-fix immediately:
enableAutofixKillSwitch()

// To re-enable:
disableAutofixKillSwitch()

// To check status:
autofixKillSwitchStatus()
```

#### 2. Code Constant (Permanent)
```typescript
// In src/hooks/use-auto-fix.ts
const AUTOFIX_KILL_SWITCH = true; // Set to true to disable
```

#### 3. Max Fixes Setting
```typescript
const MAX_FIXES_PER_SESSION = 0; // Zero disables all fixes
```

### Kill Switch Features
- **Multiple Control Points**: Browser console, code constant, or max fixes setting
- **Runtime Toggle**: Enable/disable without code changes via localStorage
- **Status Check**: `autofixKillSwitchStatus()` shows current state
- **Immediate Effect**: Prevents new fixes and stops setting up event listeners
- **Persistent**: LocalStorage setting survives page refreshes
