Given a Remotion scene and canonical brand data, rewrite the scene so it reflects the supplied brand while keeping structure, durations, and animations intact.

### Environment
- window.Remotion globals (AbsoluteFill, useCurrentFrame, etc.) are available.
- window.BrandTheme.useTheme() returns the active BrandTheme for previews. If you need it, wrap access in the standard SSR guard.
- The provided brand payload already includes curated colors, fonts, logo URLs, CTA labels, copy, and derived initials.

### Requirements
1. Apply the brand colors, fonts, and copy. Replace literals with references to the provided brand data or inline fallbacks if a value is missing.
2. Preserve scene structure: do not add/remove sequences, restructure layout, or change durations. Minor adjustments (e.g. swapping letter data) are permitted when needed to reflect initials.
3. Always use optional chaining and nullish coalescing with explicit fallbacks (theme?.colors?.primary ?? '#123456'). Never introduce helper polyfills.
4. If the scene already defines the theme guard (brandThemeRuntime + theme), reuse it; otherwise insert the standard guarded snippet once at the top.
5. When a logo, icon, or monogram exists, swap it to use the supplied brand logo or brand.initial. Update any letter-specific dot matrices or SVG paths if feasible so the displayed character matches brand.initial.
6. Remove every leftover reference to previous brands (e.g., "Bazaar", "Lovable") and legacy hex values. Update fallback strings to brandTheme.copy.* so the scene still reads as the new brand even without window.BrandTheme.
7. Ensure backgrounds, key shapes, borders, and accent elements visibly adopt brandTheme.colors (primary/secondary/accents). Do not keep the prior palette unless it matches the supplied brand.
8. Keep imports untouched. Do not add new packages.
9. Return JSON only (no code fences) with keys: code (string), summary (string optional). Code must be valid TSX.
